# Information
Contains all code and data used for:
"Mapping relationships between glutathione and SLC25 transporters in cancers using hybrid machine learning models" - Luke Kennedy, Jagdeep K Sandhu, Mary-Ellen Harper, and Miroslava Cuperlovic-Culf

All code can be run using the packages specified below and data provided in **data** to reproduce the models and results of this work (unless specified otherwise in the main text). Placeholder strings for path directories in the code should be replaced with the path to where ever the data is located on the indivdual's system. Parameters for e.g., ML algorithm or model features can be specified in the code to replicate described models or produce novel models.

**Make your own predictions**: Example files and a brief tutorial are provided at the end under **TUTORIAL** to allow users to implement their own classifier and make predictions using this framework

## classifiers
Contains all python scripts used in data pre-processing, classifier model training, testing, and evaluation used for this work.

## data
Contains all data files used in python code in this repository. 'info.txt' contains specific information for each data file.

## deepGOWeb
Contains all python scripts used for collecting required data (FASTA sequences) for calling DeepGOWeb API, and evaluation of DeepGO annotations and RF classifier annotations.

## structural_analysis
Contains all python scripts used for structural analysis of SLC25 proteins, and for generating corresponding output figures. CAVER was implemented via plugin through PyMol GUI and results are summarized in SLC25_tunnelRes.pkl, generated by mGSH_CAVER_resis.py from CAVER plugin.

## TUTORIAL
For individuals interested in applying this classifier framework to their topic or function of interest, we have provided a generic ```run_model.py``` file which can be run in the command prompt in environments which contain a Python installation with the required packages, for example:
```
python run_model.py --help
```
To get information about the various requirements to run the code.

To run a simple classifier for glutathione metabolism based on a subset of CCLE transcriptomics principal components, unzip **ccleTranscriptomics_PCA.csv** in the **data** folder and enter the following into the command prompt after changing to the directory where these files are located:
```
python run_model.py --data-path "data" --labeled-genes "example_GSHgenes.csv" --feature-data "ccleTranscriptomics_PCA.csv" --select-features 5 --iterations 10 --cpu-cores 2
```
The outputs contain test set results found in the "Results" csv file, and classification probabilites for unlabeld samples are found in the "unknownResults" csv file under "Average predicted label". 

Although this example, these classifiers predict annotations for gene ontology terms of interest based on CCLE transcriptomics data, this framework and ```run_model.py``` can be used in many applications, such as classifying metabolites based on metabolomics data. The only requirements are that rows and columns correspond to samples and features/observations for use in classifiers and that sample identifiers are consistent across files (e.g., Ensembl gene/transcript IDs, UniProt IDs, Metabolite names).

We hope this code provides an easy implementation of our classification framework which can be used to generate hypotheses for biology!
